# Build instructions
Clone the repository with a different name, example:
```git clone https://github.com/hohfchns/HOETestGame HOETestGame_temp```

[Clone the HOE engine and generate a project with the name as ```HOETestGame```](https://github.com/HO-org/HOE#readme)

**To build the game, the engine folder must remain intact. It is also recommended to clone it with an appropriate name as the engine must be cloned into a different directory for every seperate game project**

Copy the created project's contents, except for the folders ```src, resources``` and the file ```premake5.lua``` into the cloned repository. If asked do not overwrite files.

Delete the generated project and rename the repository folder to ```HOETestGame```
